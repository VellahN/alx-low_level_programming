A hash function is any function that can be used to map data of arbitrary size to fixed-size values, though there are some hash functions that support variable length output.[1] The values returned by a hash function are called hash values, hash codes, hash digests, digests, or simply hashes.[2] The values are usually used to index a fixed-size table called a hash table. Use of a hash function to index a hash table is called hashing or scatter storage addressing.

In computing, a hash table, also known as a hash map or a hash set, is a data structure that implements an associative array, also called a dictionary, which is an abstract data type that maps keys to values.[2] A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.

The benefit of using a hash table is its very fast access time. Typically, the time complexity (amortized time complexity) is a constant O(1) access time.
