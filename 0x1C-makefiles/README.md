Makefile sets a set of rules to determine which parts of a program need to be recompile, and issues command to recompile them. • Makefile is a way of automating software building procedure and other complex tasks with dependencies. • Makefile contains: dependency rules, macros and suffix(or implicit) rules.

If you want to run or update a task when certain files are updated, the make utility can come in handy. The make utility requires a file, Makefile (or makefile), which defines set of tasks to be executed. You may have used make to compile a program from source code. Most open source projects use make to compile a final executable binary, which can then be installed using make install.
